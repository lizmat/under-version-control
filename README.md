NAME
====

under::version::control - is an IO::Path under version control?

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use under::version::control;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

under::version::control provides a subroutine that returns True if the argument appears to be under version control.

This is currently defined as it having a sibling ".git" directory, or any of its parents having a ".git" directory.

Intended to be used by CLI scripts before they do massive changes on a file system: being under version control provides a bigger chance of reversibility if something went wrong.
