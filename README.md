NAME
====

under-version-control - is an IO::Path under version control?

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use under-version-control;

say "current directory is under version control"
  if ".".IO.&under-version-control;

say "file 'foo.bar' is under version control"
  if under-version-control "foo.bar".IO;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

under::version::control provides a subroutine that returns True if the argument appears to be under version control.

This is currently defined as it having a sibling ".git" directory, or any of its parents having a ".git" directory.

Intended to be used by CLI scripts before they do massive changes on a file system: being under version control provides a bigger chance of reversibility if something went wrong.

SEE ALSO
========

For more fine-grained control on whether a path is under version control, you can also use the [`Git::Files`](https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Git::Files) distribution for that, or the git related functions in [`path-utils`](https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/path-utils).
